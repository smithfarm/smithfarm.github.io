= obs-docu adoc PoC

This is a proof-of-concept (PoC) showing how the existing OBS guides could be
converted to asciidoc.

== How to see the source code

https://github.com/smithfarm/smithfarm.github.io/tree/main/asciidoc

== How to see the asciidoc as rendered by GitHub

https://github.com/smithfarm/smithfarm.github.io/blob/main/asciidoc/obs-book/obs.adoc

== How to see the "final product" rendered to GitHub Pages

https://smithfarm.github.io

== How to test/build locally

The beauty of this solution is that running test builds locally is not necessary,
because one can see the rendered asciidoc in GitHub.

That said, I do intend to include here instructions on how to bring up the toolchain
locally, without relying on some random container from who-knows-where.
