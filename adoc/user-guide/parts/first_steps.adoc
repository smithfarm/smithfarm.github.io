=== Target Audience

This document is intended for users and developers interested in
building packages from source code for different platforms and Linux
distributions. Basic knowledge of Linux and the command line usage is
recommended.

[[sec-obsbg-concept]]
=== Conceptual Overview

Created in 2005, the {obs} ({obsa}) is a generic system for
building and distributing packages or images from source code in an
automatic, consistent, and reproducible way. {obsa} can create
images and installable packages for a wide range of operating systems
({suse}, Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Windows, etc.) and hardware
architectures ({x86}, {amd64}, {zseries}, {ppc} etc.).

[[sec-obsbg-concept-pkgspec]]
==== Build Recipe

To create a package in {obsa}, you need a build recipe which
contains the following information:

* *Metadata.* The package name and the description are mandatory. Other data
such as the version, the license, the upstream URL is optional.
* *Dependencies.* Packages depend on other packages to function properly. These
relationships are referred to as "dependencies". There are two types of
dependencies: _build dependencies_ and _runtime dependencies_. Build
dependencies are packages that must be present at build time in order to
successfully build your source package. The act of building your source package
will create one or more binary packages. Each binary package can specify some
number of runtime dependencies (packages that your software needs to be present
at runtime), and the package manager will try to install these together with
your package. Both types of dependencies - build and runtime - are specified in
the build recipe. Exactly how this is done is described in the documentation of
the build system (RPM, Debian, etc.) in question and is beyond the scope of
this {obs} documentation. You need to look up documentation of the individual
package managers like https://rpm.org/ or
https://www.debian.org/doc/devel-manuals#packaging-tutorial
* *A Package List.* To successfully install and remove a package and all its
contents, the package manager needs to know which files and directories
belong to which package.

For RPM-based operating systems such as {opensuse}, {sle}, or
{rhel}, all the information above is included in a file with the
file extension `.spec`.

[[sec-obsbg-buildhost]]
==== Build Hosts and Packages

The {obsa} server provides a Web interface and an API. The API is
used by the `{osccmd}` command-line tool.

To build the package, the back end creates a sandbox with the respective
distribution. This sandbox is isolated from the rest of the host system.
Depending on the build recipe (on RPM-based systems, this is a spec
file), other packages are downloaded and installed prior to building.

The build process executes all the instructions that it finds in the
build recipe. If the build is successful, the files which belong to the
package are installed into the sandbox. From those sandboxed files, the
final RPM package is created and moved into a download area, the
_download repository_.

End users can install the package using their preferred package
management tools. On a {suse}-based system, you can use {yast}
or Zypper command-line tool to install an RPM version of the package.

Other {obsa}-related services (like the notification server, mirror
interface, etc.) perform very specific tasks and therefore beyond the
scope of this guide.

The following schematic shows the components in context:

.Conceptual Overview of {obs}
[#fig-obsbg-concept]
image::obs-concept.svg[obs-concept,scaledwidth=80.0%]

[[sec-obsbg-project]]
==== Projects and Packages

In {obsa}, packages are organized in _projects_. A single project
can contain several packages, and it usually serves a specific
organizational purpose. Generic access control, related repositories,
and build targets (operating systems and architectures) are all defined
on the project level.

Projects can also have other projects (subprojects) to structure work.
They are mostly isolated from their parent project and can be configured
individually.

Each project name is separated by colon. For example, in the {osbs},
packages for fonts are collected in the project `M17N:fonts` which is a
subproject of `M17N`. Packages for the Python programming language are
available in the `devel:languages:python` project which is a subproject of
`devel:languages` which itself is a subproject of `devel`.

As a user, you will normally build packages in your home project,
available in {obsa} as `home:USERNAME`. Home projects serve as a personal
working area in {obsa} to define build targets, upload, build, and
download packages. Users are also permitted to create subprojects for
temporary subprojects to work on other people's packages.

Sometimes, you will see the `obs://DOMAIN/PROJECT` notation. The `obs://`
schema is a shorthand to abbreviate the long URL and needs to be replaced by
the real {obsa} instance URL.

[[sec-obsbg-req]]
=== Requirements for Working with the `{osccmd}` Command-Line Tool

Before you start working with {obs}, make sure that you have met
the following requirements:

Software Requirements::
  Install the `{osccmd}` command line tool from your preferred
  distributions or from the {obsa} project `openSUSE:Tools`:
  * On {suse} systems, install the `{osccmd}` package using a command
    like `zypper install osc`.
  * On other systems, use your preferred package manager.
  * As an alternative, you can use the {osc} {appimg} file. An
    {appimg} file is a packaged application which can run on many
    distributions. Download the file from
    https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/openSUSE:/Tools/AppImage/,
    save it in your `~/bin` directory, and make the file executable.

Hardware Requirements::
  Make sure you have a minimum of 1 GB of free disk space for building
  packages locally and caching downloaded build dependencies. `{osccmd}` builds
  packages locally under `{oscbuildpath}` and caches downloaded packages under
  `{oscbuildcache}`.

[[sec-obsbg-usagescenarios]]
=== Covered Scenarios

This guide is based on the following assumptions:

* Since Git is used throughout this guide, and many {obsa} concepts
are modeled after their Subversion (SVN) equivalents, you have a working
knowledge of version control systems such as Git and Subversion (SVN).
* You are using the {osbs} at https://build.opensuse.org. If you are
using another {obsa} instance, some commands may differ.
* You have an account on an {obs} instance.
* You are running an RPM-based operating system like {opensuse} or
{sle}.
* You have configured your system for {obsa} as shown in <<sec-obsbg-obsconfig>>.

All examples use the following elements:

* A user on a local machine (you) called `{exampleuser}`. This user
builds packages on their own machine.
* An {obsa} user called `{obsuser1}` with home project `{obshome1}`
on the {obs}. This user is the same as the system user `{exampleuser1}`,
that is, you.
* An {obsa} user `{obsuser2}` and their home `{obshome2}` on {obs}.
This user acts as a collaborator.
* An example upstream open source repository at
link:{gitupstream1}[{gitupstream1}]. This repository contains source
code in the C{plus}{plus} programming language.

This guide describes the following common tasks:

[[sec-obsbg-obsconfig]]
=== Configuring Your System for {obsa}

While it is possible to use the `{osccmd}` tool without any
configuration, it is recommended to set up your system as described
below.

After all dependencies are downloaded and before the actual build
process can start, you need to enter the {rootuser} password. This
can be inconvenient when you rebuild packages frequently. The
configuration below modifies the `sudo` configuration to allow building
packages without entering the {rootuser} password. To maximize
security, only specific users can have root privileges.

Follow the steps below to customize `sudo`.

. Log in as {rootuser} and create a new group `osc`. This group will
contain all users which are allowed to build packages:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptroot} groupadd osc
....
. Add users to your newly created group `osc` which are allowed to build
packages:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptroot} usermod -a -G osc {exampleuser1}
....
+
Repeat this step to add other users, if necessary.
. Run `visudo` to create the sudoers file `/etc/sudoers.d/osc`:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptroot} visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/osc
....
. Add the following lines to create a command alias that can be executed
only by the `osc` group:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
# sudoers file "/etc/sudoers.d/osc" for the osc group
Cmnd_Alias  OSC_CMD = /usr/bin/osc, /usr/bin/build
%osc  ALL = (ALL) NOPASSWD:OSC_CMD
....
. Log out of your system and log in again to apply the changes.
. Create a new {obsa} configuration file:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc ls {obshome1}
....
+
If you run the command for the first time, you will be prompted to enter
your {obsa} user name and {obsa} password.

[NOTE]
.Alternative Directory Structure
====
If you prefer to separate projects and subprojects in directories and
subdirectories, change the following line in your configuration file
`~/.oscrc`:

....
checkout_no_colon = 1
....

This will use an alternate layout when checking out a project. For
example, setting the option above and checking out the home project will
generate the `home/{obsuser1}` directory structure instead of the
single `{obshome1}` directory.

However, this guide uses the default configuration with colons.
====

[[sec-obsbg-uc-setuphome]]
=== Setting Up Your Home Project for the First Time

This section shows how to set up your home project after creating an
{opensuse} account.

When you log in to your home project for the first time, it will be
empty. To build packages, you need to select build targets (operating
systems and architectures) first. Build targets are defined project-wide
and every package in a project is built for each build target. However,
you can disable build targets for a specific package.

You can set up your home project using the {obs} web UI as follows:

. Log in to the {obs} instance.
. Click the Your Home Project link in the Places menu on the left.
. Click the Repositories tab, then the Add from a Distribution link.
. Select the distributions you want to build for.
+
{obsa} shows several Linux distributions. For {suse}
distributions, it is recommended to activate at least {tw} and the
latest {leap} release.
+
When you select a distribution, {obsa} shows a message that the
distribution has been successfully added it to your home project.
. Click the Overview tab to see the available build targets on the right
side.

To add more build targets, repeat the procedure above.

To fine tune your build targets, click the Repositories tab, find the
respective build target, and click the Edit repository link. This shows
the available architectures and additional package repositories you can
add.

[[sec-obsbg-uc-newprj]]
=== Creating a New Package Within Your Home Project

This section demonstrates how to create packages for different
{suse} distributions from some simple C{plus}{plus} source code
hosted on {gh} (the "`upstream repository`").

[NOTE]
.Check the License First
====
Before building, go to the upstream homepage or documentation and check
the license.

For example, in the {osbs}, you may only redistribute source code
which was distributed to you under an open source license. If you are
submitting a package to {opensuse}, its source code will be checked
for license compliance. If your package is not released under an open
source license, it will be rejected.

You can find a list of already used licenses in {obsa} at
https://license.opensuse.org. For more details and a comparison of open
source licenses in general, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_free_and_open-source_software_licenses.
====

To create a package from the upstream repository, follow the steps
below.

. Set up your home project as shown in <<sec-obsbg-uc-setuphome>>.
. In the terminal, choose or create a directory on a local partition
that has enough space to hold the package sources.
. Check out your home project:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc checkout {obshome1}
....
+
This creates an empty `{obsworkdir1}` directory in the current
directory.
. Create a new package in your local working directory:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} cd {obsworkdir1}
{promptuser} osc mkpac {sampleprj}
....
. Get the source code from the upstream repository:
+
In our example, the upstream repository is hosted on {gh} and you
can use the following URL:
link:{gitupstream1}/releases[{gitupstream1}/releases]. Download the
tarball ("`Source code (tar.gz)`") and save it in the local directory 
`{obsworkdir1}/{sampleprj}`. (If there is 
no published release, click the _Clone or download_ button and download
the latest sources using the _Download ZIP_ link.)
. Create the build recipe. This file contains metadata and build
instructions.
+
In this example, we are building an RPM for {opensuse}. For
RPM-based distributions, we create a _spec file_. The skeleton of such a
spec file looks like this:
+
[[ex-obsbg-uc-basicprj-skeletonspec]]
Skeleton of a Spec File

<7> *The Files Section.* Lists all files and directories which belong to the
package.  Documentation-related files are marked with `%doc`, and they are
automatically installed in the default documentation directory.
<8> *The Changelog Section.* This section is usually empty. Instead, {obsa}
searches for a file with the extension `.changes`. If such a file exists in the
project directory, it will be automatically included as a changelog. The
changelog file itself contains a high level overview of the history of the
package.
+
For the complete spec file, see {referencespec}.
. Create a changelog file:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc vc
....
+
This command opens a text file with the following content in the default
editor:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Fri Aug 23 12:31:41 UTC 2017 - {exampleuser_mail}
....
+
Add a short summary of your changes. Usually, a changelog entry contains
a high-level overview such as the version of the software in the
package, which patches you applied, and other changes in your project.
+
Save the file and leave the editor. `{osccmd}` then creates the file
`{sampleprj}.changes`.
+
Your project directory should now look something like this:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
project directory
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {sampleprj}-{prjvers}.tar.gz
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {sampleprj}.changes
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {sampleprj}.spec
....
. Add all the files to your working directory:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc add *.spec *.changes *.tar.gz
....
. Build the package for the default build target:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc build --local-package 
....
+
NOTE: The option `--local-package` is used here, because the package is not
yet submitted to {obsa}.
+
// FIXME: how would the user find out which build targets are available?
// FIXME: i.e. without parsing the project meta XML?
// The default build target is set in the {osc} configuration file
// `~/.oscrc` using the variable `build++_++repository`. On {osbs} this
// is usually {tw}.
// +
// To build the package for another build target, use the following
// command:
// +
// [subs="+attributes"]
// ....
// {promptuser} osc build --local-package openSUSE_Tumbleweed x86_64 *.spec
// ....
. Check whether your build was successful. If everything was fine,
commit the files to your package to your home project on {obsa}:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc commit
....
+
This command commits the source code changes to the {obsa} server and triggers
server-side builds there for all configured repositories and architectures.
To see which repositories and architectures are configured, issue the following
command:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc repositories
....
+
// toms 2017-08-17: FIXME: Link to User Guide? Troubleshooting section with
// chroot and buildlog specialties?
+
If you encounter build errors or would like to take a closer look at those parts
of the build log which have disappeared from your scroll buffer, use the `osc
buildlog` (alias `osc bl`) command to review the local build log:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc buildlog openSUSE_Tumbleweed x86_64
....
+
Use the analogous `osc remotebuildlog` (alias `osc rbl`) command to review logs
from the server-side builds.

[[sec-obsbg-uc-patching]]
=== Patching Source Code

This section describes how to tell {obs} to apply a patch to your
package before building it. We use the same package as shown in
<<sec-obsbg-uc-newprj>>.

There are various reasons why you might want to patch a package:

* *You Do Not Have Permission to Commit Upstream.* Often, you cannot commit
  changes directly to the upstream repository. If you send changes to the
upstream repository, they may be integrated late or even be rejected.
+
Patch files allow making changes while keeping source code clean while
insulating your package from upstream's release cycle, coding style, and
internal workings.
* *Apply Security and Bug Fixes or Distribution-Specific Fixes.*
* *Change the Source Code, So It Builds on {obsa}.*
* *Improve Security and Traceability.* Untouched source code in {obsa} is
  easier to check for changes than a modified one. The check is usually done
  with a checksum (MD5 or SHA).
* *Improve Structure and Consistency.* From an organizational point of view, it
  is better when changes are separated from the source code. With the changes
  inside the patch file, everybody can see _what_ was changed and which files
  changes were applied to.

We assume that you already have a project as described in
<<sec-obsbg-uc-newprj>>. The project directory should look similar to this:

[subs="+attributes"]
....
project directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {sampleprj}-{prjvers}.tar.gz
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ {sampleprj}.changes
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ {sampleprj}.spec
....

In our case, we want to modify the source code under `src/main.cpp` to
change the greeting message.

. In the terminal, switch to your working directory.
. Prepare a patch file:
.. Unpack the source code:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} tar xvf {sampleprj}-*.tar.gz
....
+
If you have downloaded the archive from {gh}, the archive contains a
directory in the form `NAME-VERSION`. In our case, unpacking the
downloaded archive results in the `{sampleprj}-{prjvers}/`
directory.
.. Switch to the directory `{sampleprj}-{prjvers}/` and make a
copy of the original C{plus}{plus} source file:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} cd {sampleprj}-{prjvers}/
{promptuser} cp src/main.cpp src/main.cpp.orig
....
.. Make your changes in `src/main.cpp`.
.. Create a diff and carefully inspect your changes:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} diff -u src/main.cpp.orig src/main.cpp
....
+
The output should look like this:
+
[source,diff]
----
--- src/main.cpp.orig   2017-08-09 16:28:31.407449707 +0200
+++ src/main.cpp        2017-08-09 16:28:49.131541230 +0200
@@ -2,7 +2,7 @@

 int main()
 {
-    std::cout{lt}{lt}"Hello OBS!\n";
+    std::cout{lt}{lt}"Hello Alice!\n";

     return 0;
 }
----
.. Redirect the diff into a file:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} diff -u src/main.cpp.orig src/main.cpp \
  > ../{sampleprj}_main.diff
....
+
You can use an arbitrary name for the patch file. However, we recommend
giving the file a descriptive name and adding the name of the upstream
project. If there is a bug or issue number associated with the patch,
add it to the file name as well. You can either use `.diff` or `.patch`
as the file extension.
.. You can now remove the directory `{sampleprj}-{prjvers}/`, as
it is not needed anymore.
. Open your spec file and add the following line in the header under the
`Source` line like this:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
Source:         {sampleprj}-%\{version}.tar.gz
Patch0:         {sampleprj}_main.diff
....
. In the `%prep` section, add the `%patch` macro:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
%prep
%setup -q -n %\{name}-%\{version}
%patch -P 0
....
. Add your patch file to the local repository:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc add {sampleprj}_main.diff
....
. Rebuild your package:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc build
....
. If everything was successful, commit your changes:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc commit
....
+
When prompted, specify and save a commit message.

If you are dealing with a lot of patches, you might find the `quilt`
tool useful. For more information about `quilt`, see
https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/quilt.

[[sec-obsbg-uc-branchprj]]
=== Branching a Package

This section describes how to collaborate between projects. You can
branch any package in {obsa} into any project that you have write
permission for. By default, new branches are created as a subproject of
your home project. These default branches have names beginning with
`{obsbranch1}`.

There are different reasons to branch a package:

* To modify the source code of the package, build it, try the effect of the
changes, and submit them back to the original project. Usually,
you use this workflow when you do not have write permissions for a
project.
* To make changes without affecting the original project.
* To apply temporary changes to try out a different path of development.

Let us assume that there is an {obsa} user `{obsuser1}` who has created
a package `{obshome1}/{sampleprj}` on
{obsa}. Now, a second user, `{obsuser2}`, would like to submit a
code change request to that package.

Now, imagine that you are `{obsuser2}` and you would like to branch
{obsuser1}'s package into your home project and work on it:

. In the terminal, choose or create a directory on a local partition
with enough free space.
. Create a branch from {obsuser1}'s home project:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser2} osc branchco {obshome1} {sampleprj}
....
+
This creates a project `{obsbranch2}:{obshome1}` in {obsa}, and in it
a package {sampleprj}. It also checks this package out
locally, creating a local directory `{obsbranch2}:{obshome1}/{sampleprj}` 
. Change the working directory to that local checkout:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser2} cd {obsbranch2}:{obshome1}/{sampleprj}
....
. Make changes as shown in <<sec-obsbg-uc-patching>>.
. Build the package for the default build target:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc build
....
+
NOTE: In this case, we do not use the option `--local-package` because the package
exists server-side on {obsa}, having been created there by the `osc branchco`
command we just ran.
+
. Review the build log:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc buildlog openSUSE_Tumbleweed x86_64
....
. Make sure all included and removed files are added to the {obsa}
repository:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser2} osc addremove
....
. If everything was successful, commit your changes:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc commit
....
+
When prompted, specify and save a commit message.
. Submit the changes for approval by creating a submitrequest ("`SR`"):
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser2} osc sr
....
+
Used like this without any arguments, the `osc sr` (`osc submitreq`) command
submits the package back to where you originally branched it from.
+
NOTE: With the `osc sr` command, you submit a specific version of the source.
If you commit changes later, before the earlier SR gets accepted, {osc} will
detect the earlier SR and ask you whether you want to supersede it with the
newer source.
+
If you would rather be explicit about what to submit and where to submit it
to, use the full syntax `osc sr SOURCEPRJ PKG DESTPRJ` - i.e., in the present case:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser2} osc sr {obsbranch2}:{obshome1} {sampleprj} {obshome1}
....

User `{obsuser2}` has finished the task now and the SR is assigned to
`{obsuser1}`. User `{obsuser1}` can now either accept or decline it. Also, as
long as the SR remains open, `{obsuser2}` can also supersede it with a new
request to reflect any additional code changes that may be needed:

* *Accept the SR.* The changes from user `{obsuser2}` will be
  integrated into the {obshome1} project. The accepted SR will be
  closed. To make further changes, {obsuser2} will to create a new
  SR.
* *Decline the SR.* The changes from user `{obsuser2}` are not integrated into
  the {obshome1} project, but that user can still address the reasons why
  the original SR was declined and supersede it with a new SR.
+
Reasons for declining a submit requires can be build errors or style
issues. The reviewer usually gives a reason when declining the submit
request. User {obsuser2} can then 1) correct their submission using
a new submit request that supersedes the previous one, 2) disagree and
reopen the request, or 3) accept the decline and revoke the request.
* *Supersede the SR.* As long as the SR is still open (and this includes the
  case when it has been declined), `{obsuser2}` can continue making changes in
  their local checkout and, at any time, issue a new submit request using the
  above workflow. At submission time, {obsa} will detect the existing (previous)
  SR and ask the submitter whether they would like to supersede it. If
  `{obsuser2}` answers "yes" here, the new SR will supersede the previous one.
  Alternatively, by answering "no" to the supersede question, a second SR will be
  created alongside the previous one.

User `{obsuser1}` is responsible for the following:

NOTE: If preferred, the below steps can also be performed using the OBS web UI.
Requests can be managed under the Tasks tab.

. Show all open SRs targeting your home project
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc rq list -P {obshome1}
....
. Find the correct SR. Once you know the SR number:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc request show 246
....
. Review the SR and decide:
+
Accept the submit request:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc rq accept 246 --message="Reviewed OK."
....
+
Decline the SR and give a reason:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc rq decline 256 --message="Declined, because of missing semicolon."
....

When the SR is accepted, the changes in the SR are integrated
into the target package (`{obshome1}/{sampleprj}` in this case).

If the SR is declined, the submitter can fix the issues and
resubmit the package. When creating a new SR for to resubmit
updated code changes, the submitter would answer "yes" when {osc}
prompts to supersede the previous SR.

=== Installing Packages from {obsa}

Projects on {obsa} can be configured to create _download repositories_ containing the
binary packages (RPMs, DEBs, etc.) produced when it builds your sources.
These repositories can be as installation sources for distro-specific package management
utilities such as Zypper, YaST, apt-get, yum, etc.

The process of creating and updating download repositories is called "publishing".

Normally, when you create a package in your {obsa} home project, after a
successful server-side build the {obsa} will "publish" the build artifacts
to repositories. In our example, these repositories appear as directories
at the URL link:{obsdnlurlhome1}[{obsdnlurlhome1}].

However, publishing is not enabled on all projects. For example, projects
that get created via branching (as in our `osc branchco` example, above)
have publishing disabled by default. If you need artifacts from server-side
builds in such projects, you can download them with `osc getbinaries`.

For example, if you have enabled the {tw} distribution, all packages
for {tw} will be published at
link:{obsdnlurlhome1}/openSUSE_Tumbleweed[{obsdnlurlhome1}/openSUSE++_++Tumbleweed].

Let's assume you are running {tw} and you wish to install the {sampleprj}
package from your home project. Also, when newer builds of the package are
published, you would like your system to download and install them
automatically when updating installed packages:

. Inside your working directory, determine the download repository URLs:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptuser} osc repourls
{obsdnlurlhome1}/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/{obshome1}.repo
{obsdnlurlhome1}/openSUSE_42.2/{obshome1}.repo
....
. Copy the desired URL of your preferred distribution. In our case, that
is the line containing `openSUSE++_++Tumbleweed`.
. Use `zypper` and add the repo:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptroot} zypper addrepo {obsdnlurlhome1}/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/{obshome1}.repo
....
+
When prompted, accept the GPG key of the download repository.
. Install the package:
+
[subs="+attributes"]
....
{promptroot} zypper install {sampleprj}
....

When a newer build of the package is published, re-running Step 4 again will
install it. You do not need to execute Step 1, as the repository is already
configured in your system.

=== Other Useful `{osccmd}` Commands

The following list gives you a short overview of frequently used
`{osccmd}` subcommands that have not yet been mentioned in this guide. For an
overview of their syntax, use `osc SUBCOMMAND --help`.

`osc diff`::
  Generates a diff, comparing local changes against the remote
  {obsa} project.
`osc list`::
  Shows source or binaries on an {obsa} server.
`osc prjresults`::
  Shows project-wide build results.
`osc status`::
  Shows the status of files in your working directory
